Given an integer array nums, find a subarray that has the largest product, and return the product.
The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.
=============================
UMPIRE
• Understand

Ask clarifying questions and use examples to understand what the interviewer wants out of this problem.
Choose a “happy path” test input, different than the one provided, and a few edge case inputs.
Verify that you and the interviewer are aligned on the expected inputs and outputs
1. Can input array be null or empty?
2. Can the subarray has more than 2 numbers?
3. Can I choose any number in the array and multiply it?
4. Will it has negative number or zero?


• Match
1. See if this problem matches a problem category (e.g. Strings/Arrays) and strategies or patterns within the category
So this is an array problem.


• Plan
1. Sketch visualizations and write pseudocode
2. Walk through a high-level implementation with an existing diagram

• Implement
1. Implement the solution (make sure to know what level of detail the interviewer wants)

• Review
1. Re-check that your algorithm solves the problem by running through important examples
2. Go through it as if you are debugging it, assuming there is a bug

• Evaluate
1. Finish by giving space and run-time complexity
2. Discuss any pros and cons of the solution
