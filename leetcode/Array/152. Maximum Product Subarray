UMPIRE
• Understand

1. Ask clarifying questions and use examples to understand what the interviewer wants out of this problem.
2. Choose a “happy path” test input, different than the one provided, and a few edge case inputs.
3. Verify that you and the interviewer are aligned on the expected inputs and outputs

• Match
1. See if this problem matches a problem category (e.g. Strings/Arrays) and strategies or patterns within the category

• Plan
1. Sketch visualizations and write pseudocode
2. Walk through a high-level implementation with an existing diagram

• Implement
1. Implement the solution (make sure to know what level of detail the interviewer wants)

• Review
1. Re-check that your algorithm solves the problem by running through important examples
2. Go through it as if you are debugging it, assuming there is a bug

• Evaluate
1. Finish by giving space and run-time complexity
2. Discuss any pros and cons of the solution
