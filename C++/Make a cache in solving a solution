When we try to do leetcode, we need to memorize the visited path in DFS or solved subcase in backtracking sometimes.
Therefore, a cache is crucial.
In python, we can simply use dp = {}, dp[i, j]=true
However, in C++ we need some more work.

1. Use hash map
unordered_map<pair<int, int>, bool> dp;
But hash in C++ only support some built-in type, not <int, int>.
We need to make our own hash function to support it.
unordered_map<pair<int, int>, bool, hash_pair> dp;

2. Use 2-D array

3. Use nested map
unordered_map<int, unordered_map<int, bool>> dp;
